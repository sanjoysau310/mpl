            Before starting we all need to know some rules, Jiski Bat, Uski
            First Batting. Deewar ke uss taraf gaya toh out. Khadoos uncle ke
            ghar mein ball gayi toh out. Joh gutter mein shot marga woh ball
            layega.  This all started from a gully in a small locality of India,
            Katjunagar where some kids started playing cricket in the streets of
            their locality. They often had to change their destinations in that
            small locality as there was always someone who used to say "NIJER
            BARIR SHAMNE GIYE KHEL".  The best moment for anyone who has played
            gully cricket was breaking someone's window glass while trying to
            hit a six and then running from there. Each and everyone used to run
            in different directions someone with a bat and someone with the
            ball. We all grew up from kids to teens and decided to organize a
            tournament just like 'IPL' in our gully and it was named RCL (Rising
            star cricket league) and from that day our journey started. As we
            grew up it wasn't possible for us to conduct that tournament in the
            gully because of those 'khadoos uncles'.  Hence we shifted the
            tournament from the gully to Katjunagar playground where we
            ourselves made a pitch and organized this tournament, at first there
            were only 5 teams with 4 players, and nowadays there is always an
            overflow of players. last year we organized this tournament with 10
            teams having 11 players each. Last year we also created our club
            named "MUSKETEERS CLUB" for organizing different sports events. And
            those kids who started the tournament are now the organizers of this
            huge tournament.
